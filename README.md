#  Gigabyte scale Amazon Product Reviews Sentiment Analysis Challenge: A scalable pySPARK NLP Machine Learning Pipeline hosted on AWS EMR Cloud
AWS cloud deployment of big data train/test pipeline of gigabyte scale NLP machine learning algorithm to analyze the sentiment of Amazon product reviews using AWS elastic map reduce architecture. The object oriented code was implemented using pySpark machine learning and pySpark SQL libraries. Prior to building the big data solution, I
did extensive data cleaning, feature engineering, data visualization, and built prototype models to investigate the underlying data using sci-kit learn and seaborn.
